# GEOS Aerosol Mie table Definition for each of species.
# This example is for calculating PM2.5 concentrations for the MERRA-2 GEOS configuration.
# Note that Nitrate and Brown Carbon are not included in this system.
# The order of the tracers and rhod correspond to the bins in the optics netcdf files.
#
#  rhod: particle density in kg m-3
#  shapefactor: factor that accounts for aerodynamic resistance of non-spherical particles
#               this is used to calculate the aerodynamic radius for PM calculations when the aerodymic flag is turned on

#  pmconversion: additional factor for unaccounted aerosol species. was implemented to allow for sulfate to represent missing ammonium in MERRA-2.
#                pmconversion = 1.3756 for Sulfate
